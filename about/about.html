        <h2>About <span class="name">The Godfather (1972)</span></h2>
        <p>
          The Godfather is a movie about organized crime, focusing on one
          dynasty in particular. But it’s most specifically a movie about
          fathers and sons, which may be the quality that gives it such enduring
          power. Its violence is vigorous and brutal; in adapting Mario Puzo’s
          novel, Francis Ford Coppola gives us a portrait of domineering
          masculinity in overdrive. But there’s a strange tenderness at work in
          it too, all radiating from and toward Marlon Brando’s crime boss Don
          Vito Corleone. He wields power over every outsider who has come to—or
          been forced to—respect him. But his relationships with his sons by
          birth, James Caan’s Sonny, Al Pacino’s Michael and John Cazale’s
          Fredo, as well as his de facto adopted son, Robert Duvall’s Tom Hagen,
          generate the fierce energy that drives the film. He’s their sun king,
          the figure whose approval and affection they crave, a blazing light
          that can make or break them.
